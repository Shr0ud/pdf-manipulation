# pdf-manipulation
Contains 3 Python scripts:
1. for rotating pdfs by 180 degress, I wrote it to rotate my academic transcript which was scanned the wrong way
2. for merging my pdfs together, so that people working on separate parts for a school project could be combined into one
3. for adding watermarks to pdfs for a club print
